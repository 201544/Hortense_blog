| General topic               | GPs say to get pregnant to reduce pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Procedure/what was examined | Experts want more research and mindfulness about endometriosis. Sophie Buchan's GP said her to get pregnant to reduce pain. Prof Andrew Horne disagree with him. Nobody can tell a woman to get pregnant. Ethnic minorities are even more affected by this problem |
| Conclusions                 | Diagnosis endometriosis is difficult because symptoms are similar to other ilnessess. Laser surgery can perforate bowel.                                                                                                                                           |
