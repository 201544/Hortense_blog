Have you ever heard about endometriosis ? Endometriosis is a benign illness but incurable. At the moment, we do not know about origin and cure. 
I decided to take “Endometriosis” as subject because I have heard a lot about it in the last few months. I realised that it is a taboo subject and many women around me suffer from it. So I wanted to know more about this disease: why does it take so long to diagnose, why is there no cure? Why is it so taboo? So many questions that I will try to answer through this work. 
I want to be able to explain what this disease is, what it involves and try to make as many people as possible aware of endometriosis. 
You are not alone, Girls. Boys are welcome too, educate yourself.
