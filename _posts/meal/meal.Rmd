I watched a documentary about a murderer, it was rather noice :3

# Log n°2 (10/24/2020)
I start a new series (in English of course) : Peaky Blinders ! Do you know that is based on true story ? Series shows crimes committed by Shelby family. Of course, facts are overplayed for the show. 

... more informations are coming, plz wait. 

What do you think about PB ? (Spoilers are banned!!)
