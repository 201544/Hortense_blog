| General topic                | Type of endometriosis caused by a mutation in a gene called ARID1A                                                                                                                                            |
| Procedure/What was examined  | - Mutation of gene ARID1A -Drug effect on spread of endometriosis                                                                                                                                             |
| Conclusions/ discovery       | -Endometriosis caused by mutation in a gene is the most severe form -Treatment by drug could be more effective  -Drug target a protein in cells called P300 -Search to found other drugs with same fonctions  |
